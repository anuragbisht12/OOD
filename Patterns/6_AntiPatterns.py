"""
Four aspects of bad design:
1. Immobile: hard to reuse
2. Rigid:   small cchange may take too many changes
3. Fragile: any change can break current application
4. Viscose: Changes done in the code environment 

Types of antipatterns:
1, Software development Antipattern
2. Software architecture Antipattern

1. Software Development Antipattern

1.1 Spaghetti Code
Ignorance on OOP
Product architecture not considered
quick fix mentality

1.2 Golden Hammer
A hammer for all kinds of nails, whether it suits the need or not

Usecases:
recommendation from top people
solution has yielded a lot of benefits in the past
a company is stuck with this technology

1.3 Lava Flow
unusable piece of code lying in the application, fear of breaking if it is modified.

causes:
lot of trial and error code
single handedly written code that is not reviewed 

Symptoms:
low code coverage
lot of commented code
obsolete interfaces or developers try to work around existing code

1.4 Copy and paste or cut and paste programming

causes:
lack of long term thinking
ccp

consequences:
higher maintenance costs
increased bug life cycle
less modular code base


2. Software Architecture Antipatterns

2.1 Reinventing the wheel
devising new architecture and not using the similar architecture

Causes:
absence of central documentation or repository
building from scratch

Consequences:
too many solutions to solve one standard problem
closed system architecture

2.2 Vendor lock-in
product companies tend to be dependent on some of the technology


2.3 Design by committee
wrong or inexperience people designed the product
